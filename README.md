## Role Variables

| Variable | Default | Description
|-|-|-|
| ufw_ipv6 | `yes` | `no` disables IPv6 support |

| interface | | By default a rule is applied to all interfaces, not applied when using interface_in and interface_out |
| interface_in | | Interface for incoming traffic |
| interface_out | | Interface for outgoing traffic |
| direction | `in` | Direction of traffic, not applied when using interface_in and interface_out |
| rule | | Choices are `allow`, `deny`, `limit` and `reject` |
| from_ip | `any` | Source IP or subnet |
| from_port | | Source port |

## Dependencies

This role does not have any dependencies.

## Example Playbook

This is the most basic playbook without any rules and a basic UFW configuration:

```yml
---
- hosts: servers
  roles:
      - ansible_ufw
```

This is an example playbook with some firewall rules: 

```yml
---
- hosts: servers
  vars:
    ufw_rules:
      - rule: limit
        to_port: 22
        proto: tcp
      - rule: allow
        route: yes
        interface_in: eth0
        interface_out: eth1
        to_port: 8080
        proto: tcp
      - rule: deny
        route: yes
        interface: eth1
        from_ip: 1.2.3.0/24
        to_ip: 5.5.0.0/16
  roles:
      - ansible_ufw
```
